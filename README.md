Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non- existent credit histories. Home credit strives to focus on responsible lending primarily to people with little or no credit history.Aiming of Kaggle competition is to predict their clients' repayment abilities. Doing so will ascertain capable clients are not rejected.

I used Zeppelin and pyspark as environment in this prediction.

While Spark is Analytic engine for big data processing and easy of use. Spark uses Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL as programming language, and I used Python (Pyspark) as a programming language. One of the advantages of Spark is speed,which is can run workloads 100x faster.
